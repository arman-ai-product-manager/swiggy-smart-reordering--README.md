# Swiggy Smart Reordering – How AI Helped People Never Forget Milk Again

A story-based case study showing how Swiggy could use machine learning to remind users to reorder their daily groceries on time.

---

## The Problem

Meet Rohit — a busy professional who orders groceries like milk, eggs, and bread from Swiggy Instamart.

But sometimes, he forgets to reorder until the last minute.  
And he's not alone. Thousands of users forget to reorder daily essentials.

Swiggy asked:

> “What if we could remind people before they forget?”

---

## The Idea

Swiggy decided to create a Smart Reordering System using machine learning to:

- Track user buying patterns
- Predict when someone might need something again
- Send a reminder at the right time

---

## How It Works

1. System learns:
   - Rohit orders milk every 7 days
   - Usually on Saturdays at 9 PM

2. On day 6, Swiggy sends a message:
   > “Hey Rohit, ready for your weekly milk run?  
   > Click here to reorder in 1 tap.”

3. Rohit taps, confirms, and the order is placed.

No searching. No remembering. Just smart reordering.

## Results

- Reorders increased by 24%
- Less time spent by users browsing
- Personalized reminders led to better engagement
- More repeat purchases for Swiggy

- `model/reorder_prediction_model.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook (if available)
- `data/reorder-patterns-sample.csv` – Sample data
- `assets/` – Screenshots or visuals

## What’s Next?

This system can be improved by:

- Auto-reordering options (subscriptions)
- Multi-language reminders
- Expanding to other products like snacks, toiletries, etc.

---

## Key Takeaway

A simple idea — predicting when users need something — can make a big difference.

Smart Reordering made the app more helpful and improved the overall experience.
